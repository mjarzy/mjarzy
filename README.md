### Favorite Equation - [General Relativty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity)

### $R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} g_{\mu\nu} R + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}$

[Albert Einstein's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) field equations show how mass and energy curve spacetime, leading to black holes, gravitational waves, and the ever expanding universe—all proven true!
